      "content":"I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

        "content":"I encountered StackUp while scrolling through TikTok in 2022, and it has been fun, challenging and rewarding to say the least. The exposure to all these tools and frameworks used in the industry has been very vital in expanding my knowledge base, strenghtening my ability to solve problems by widening the scope of my solutions. \n\nMy journey has also been a little rewarding; this is my ffirst time getting paid online by a company. It's also exciting that I'm paid to learn the tech skills I've always wanted to learn.",
